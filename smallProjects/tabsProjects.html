                                 need to account for the arousal and direction of behavior.
                                  Human and animal activity occurs in peaks and troughs and
                                   it shifts its direction from one goal to another many times throughout a day.</p>

                                Having a clear vision of what you want to achieve
                                 in the future and becoming who you want to be is
                                  one of the most powerful ideas you need to achieve 
                                  extraordinary success in life. Vision is more important than goals.
                                   In fact, vision should come first before you can talk about setting goals.

                                You are your own best motivator. 
                                Your motivation must come from within yourself.
                                 Others may try to encourage you, but you are 
                                 the only one who can attain what you desire.
                                  You must convince yourself - you can!
